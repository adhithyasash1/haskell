Haskell has numerous built-in functions that provide powerful tools for functional programming. Here's a list of some useful built-in functions in Haskell:

Basic Functions:

id: The identity function that returns its argument unchanged.
const: Takes two arguments and returns the first one, ignoring the second.
(.): Function composition operator, allows chaining functions together.
List Functions:

head: Returns the first element of a list.
tail: Returns all but the first element of a list.
init: Returns all but the last element of a list.
last: Returns the last element of a list.
length: Returns the length of a list.
null: Checks if a list is empty.
take: Takes a specified number of elements from the beginning of a list.
drop: Drops a specified number of elements from the beginning of a list.
elem: Checks if an element is present in a list.
filter: Filters elements in a list based on a predicate.
map: Applies a function to each element of a list and returns a new list.
foldl and foldr: Perform left and right folds, respectively, on a list.
zip: Combines two lists into a list of pairs.
Tuple Functions:

fst: Extracts the first component of a pair.
snd: Extracts the second component of a pair.
zipWith: Applies a function to pairs of elements from two lists.
Numeric Functions:

abs: Returns the absolute value of a number.
max and min: Returns the maximum and minimum of two numbers, respectively.
sum: Returns the sum of elements in a list.
product: Returns the product of elements in a list.
Higher-order Functions:

curry: Converts a function taking multiple arguments into a series of functions, each taking one argument.
uncurry: Converts a curried function back into a function taking multiple arguments.
flip: Takes a function and returns a new function with the order of its arguments reversed.
IO Functions:

putStrLn: Outputs a string to the console.
getLine: Reads a line of input from the console.
read: Parses a string into a specified type.
Maybe Functions:

Maybe: A data type representing optional values (Just x or Nothing).
maybe: Takes a default value and a Maybe value, returns the default if Nothing, otherwise applies a function to the Just value.
Either Functions:

Either: A data type representing values with two possibilities (Either a b).
either: Takes two functions and an Either value, applies the appropriate function based on Left or Right value.
These are just a selection of the many built-in functions in Haskell. Haskell's standard library, along with additional community-contributed packages, provides a rich ecosystem of functions and utilities for various programming tasks.
